This is a personal repository for storing generalized code snippets, interesting datasets, and reference files that I compiled to help with data cleaning and inference work encountered while completing classwork and research work. 

## Files Within: 
- ðŸ§¹ **[common_cleaning_inference_functions.py](https://github.com/connixu/panic_at_the_discode/blob/master/common_cleaning_inference_functions.py)** Common functions encountered for data cleaning in python.  
- ðŸš— **[vehiclemake.csv](https://github.com/connixu/panic_at_the_discode/blob/master/vehicle_make.csv)** - Vehicle Make Reference File - Based on 311 dataset of parking tickets, this csv is a lookup file to help standardize vehicle make names in related data sets.
